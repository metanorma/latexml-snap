= latexml-snap: LaTeXML Snap Package

== Installation

The released LaTeXML snap package is located at Snapcraft: https://snapcraft.io/latexml[LaTeXML snap].


== Building the package

* Run `snapcraft snap` in the root directory of this repo


== Testing the package

If you are on macOS you can install snap to any of your multipass instances with:

[source,sh]
----
multipass transfer latexml_*_amd64.snap ${instance-name}:/home/multipass
multipass shell ${instance-name}
sudo snap install --devmode latexml_*_amd64.snap
----

After this the snap is ready to use.


=== Testing uninstallation

Execute the following command to uninstall LaTeXML.

[source,sh]
----
sudo snap remove latexml
----

After executing the uninstall ensure that the `latexml` executable is no longer found.

You can also try running `latexml --VERSION` from the command-line to see if it is still installed.
